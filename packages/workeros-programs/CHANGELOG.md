# Changelog — @opentf/workeros-programs

The OS programs package: installable `/bin` programs plus the Node-compatible
guest runtime. Format:
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). No release cut yet — see
**Unreleased**.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Program registry** (`src/index.js`) — one extensible list the kernel worker
  installs into the VFS at boot. Adding a program is a single entry (no package per
  program). Entries carry a `type` (`js` now, `wasm` later).
- **`npm`** (`src/npm/`) — the package manager, installed at `/bin/npm` and run
  from `wsh` (INV-1 — npm is just a program). Commands: `init`, `install [pkg…]`
  (npm-registry packument fetch, semver resolution — `^`/`~`/x-ranges/dist-tags,
  tarball download → in-browser `DecompressionStream` gunzip → untar into
  `<cwd>/node_modules`, transitive deps), `run <script>` (via `sys.exec`), `ls`.
- **WASI Preview 1 host** (`src/wasi/`) — `createWasiImports()` provides the
  `wasi_snapshot_preview1` import module bound to the kernel's `sys` syscalls, so an
  **unmodified `wasm32-wasip1` binary runs as a WorkerOS process** (the program
  worker reads the `.wasm` from the VFS, instantiates it, and calls `_start`).
  First slice: stdout/stderr, args, environ, clocks, random, and `proc_exit` work;
  blocking reads and the filesystem (`fd_read`, `path_open`, …) return `ENOSYS`/EOF
  until the SAB synchronous-syscall channel lands (ADR-010/-016) — the next WASI
  increment. Verified with a real rustc-built binary (`println!` + compute → stdout).
- **Node-compatible runtime** (`src/node/`) — the guest Node layer:
  - `process` shim (`argv`/`env`/`stdout`/`stderr`/`exit`).
  - CommonJS runtime (`createNodeRuntime`): a `require()` with relative +
    `node_modules` resolution (`exports`/`main`, `.js`/`.cjs`/`.json` + `index`
    fallbacks), reading files via `sys` and async-prefetching the graph so
    `require` is synchronous. Powers `node index.js` resolving installed packages.

### Notes
- Consolidated from the former `@opentf/workeros-npm` and `@opentf/workeros-node`
  packages so all OS programs and the node runtime live in one place.
- Node compatibility is an ongoing, incremental effort. Dependency dedupe is basic
  (hoist, first-writer-wins); lifecycle scripts and lockfiles are not implemented.
