# WorkerOS — Implementation Plan

Phased build with hard exit criteria. Each phase is **gated**: do not begin a phase until the prior phase's exit criteria are demonstrably met. Phases 0–2 are the MVP. Everything from Phase 3 onward is post-MVP and individually optional/orderable.

Conventions: **[MVP]** = required for the first usable milestone · **[post-MVP]**. Cross-references point at `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§) and `DECISIONS.md` (ADR-###).

---

## Phase 0 — Scaffold & harness · [MVP]

**Goal:** A buildable Rust→wasm kernel skeleton, a host runtime that boots it in a worker, and a test harness — no execution yet.

- Workspace: `workeros-kernel` (Rust lib, `cdylib` + native test target), `workeros-web` (wasm-bindgen bindings + host JS runtime), `workeros-node` (empty stub; later folded into `workeros-programs/node`).
- Kernel builds to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and loads in a Web Worker; a `boot()` returns a version handshake to the main thread.
- Control transport up: `postMessage` message framing + a `SharedArrayBuffer` ring-buffer primitive with `Atomics.wait`/`notify` (the synchronous syscall channel, ADR-010). Unit-test the ring buffer natively.
- Cross-origin isolation dev server (COOP/COEP headers) so SAB works locally.
- CI: `cargo test` (native), `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`, a headless-browser smoke test that boots the kernel.

**Exit criteria:**
- `boot()` round-trips a handshake main→kernel→main in a real browser.
- SAB ring buffer passes native concurrency tests (producer/consumer, block-until-data).
- CI green on native tests + wasm build + headless boot.

---

## Phase 1 — VFS + syscall spine · [MVP]

**Goal:** The kernel's authoritative core: filesystem, process table (data only), and the WASI-shaped syscall dispatch — still no guest execution.

- `Vfs` trait + in-memory implementation (inode tree). Ops: open/read/write/close/seek, mkdir/readdir/unlink, path normalization, cwd. (§9, ADR-011)
- Process table structure: `pid/ppid/argv/env/cwd/state/stdio/exit_code/start_time`. Allocation, lookup, reap. No workers yet — populate via test fixtures. (§5)
- Syscall dispatch layer implementing the WASI P1 host surface against the VFS/stdio: `fd_read/fd_write/fd_close/fd_seek`, `path_open/path_create_directory/path_unlink_file/fd_readdir`, `args_get/environ_get` (+ `_sizes`), `clock_time_get`, `random_get`, `proc_exit`. (§6.1, ADR-005)
- Capability set type: which fds/env/argv/`otf:*` a process may use.

**Exit criteria:**
- Full VFS unit-test suite (native) passes, including path edge cases and readdir.
- A simulated "process" fixture can perform a scripted sequence of WASI calls (open→write→seek→read→close) entirely through the dispatch layer, asserting VFS state.
- Zero Node-isms in the kernel (grep gate in CI for forbidden identifiers — enforces INV-1/ADR-007).

---

## Phase 2 — Run a JS program · [MVP] ← first usable milestone

**Goal:** The headline MVP capability: `spawn` a JS file, it runs on the host engine in its own worker, stdout/stderr/exit flow back.

- Program worker: thin JS shim that receives {source, capability set, transport endpoint} and evaluates the JS module on the host engine (`Full` level first, ADR-009/§7.1).
- `otf:spawn` wired end-to-end: kernel resolves entrypoint via the Rust resolver (§7), creates a worker, injects source + caps, registers the process.
- stdio streaming: guest `console.log`/writes → `fd_write` → kernel → main-thread stdout stream. stderr + exit code likewise.
- `otf:kill` / hard `terminate()` for runaway processes; `wait(pid)`.
- Minimal Node `process` shim (now in `workeros-programs/node`): just enough `process` (`argv`, `env`, `stdout.write`, `exit`) for ordinary scripts. **No `require` graph yet** beyond relative `import` of local files via the kernel resolver.
- Public client API on main thread: `boot()`, `fs.write(path, bytes)`, `spawn(argv)`, `onStdout`, `onExit`.

**Exit criteria (the MVP acceptance test):**
- Given a JS file written into the VFS, `spawn(["node", "main.js"])` (or `spawn(["js","main.js"])`) runs it and streams correct stdout/stderr and a correct exit code.
- A relative `import "./util.js"` resolves through the kernel and executes.
- An infinite-loop program can be killed from the host via `otf:kill` without freezing the kernel or other processes (proves ADR-003/-004).
- Two programs run concurrently in separate workers and interleave output (proves real parallelism).

> **Ship checkpoint.** At the end of Phase 2 WorkerOS does the thing the whole design was gated on: *run a JS program, get results, kill it, run several at once* — with a Rust-authoritative kernel and a real per-process worker model. Everything below is expansion.

---

## Phase 3 — Shell + coreutils · [post-MVP]

**Goal:** A usable interactive surface.

- `wsh` (§10, ADR-012): argv, env assignment, `cd`/`pwd`, run program, exit codes → then pipes `|`, redirects `> >> <`, `&&`/`||`/`;`, globbing, quoting.
- IPC pipes via `otf:ipc_open` so `A | B` streams concurrently (§6.3, ADR-006).
- Coreutils as guest programs against the VFS: `ls cat cp mv rm mkdir echo pwd env true false`.
- `ps` / `jobs` / background `&` reading the process table.
- xterm-style terminal binding on the host. **✅ done** — a real **TTY layer**: the
  kernel owns a controlling-terminal device (`workeros-kernel/tty.rs`) with a line
  discipline (canonical/raw, echo, editing, `Ctrl-C`/`Ctrl-D`/`Ctrl-Z`, winsize),
  terminal `stdin` reads block through it, and `isatty`/termios/winsize are exposed
  over the wasm bindings. The kernel worker runs the shell REPL against the TTY; the
  playground renders it with **xterm.js** (vendored same-origin), shipping raw
  keystrokes to `os.input()` and painting `os.onOutput()`. Verified end-to-end in a
  headless browser (pipes, line editing, `Ctrl-C` interrupt). **Guest terminal
  awareness ✅** — WASI `isatty(0..2)` returns true (stdio is a non-seekable
  character device) and the node runtime sets `process.*.isTTY` +
  `stdout.columns`/`rows` (via new `isatty`/`winsize` syscalls), reversing the
  Phase-5 `isTTY=false` stopgap. **Cooperative signals ✅** — a foreground process
  that installs a `SIGINT` handler catches `Ctrl-C` instead of being killed;
  `SIGWINCH` is delivered on resize (refreshing `process.stdout.columns`/`rows`);
  `SIGTSTP` is delivered on `Ctrl-Z` (default: ignore). Remaining TTY follow-ups:
  real **job control** (`SIGTSTP` suspend + `fg`/`bg`, process groups); async
  signal delivery to **WASI** guests (only JS guests are cooperative today);
  readline-style history + in-line cursor editing; a `require('tty')`/`node:tty`
  builtin (gated on the node: builtin registry, Phase 5 §C); WASI termios/
  window-size are not expressible in Preview 1.

**Exit criteria:** `echo hi | cat > f && cat f` produces `hi`; `ps` lists live processes; a backgrounded job survives and is killable; coreutils pass a behavior test suite.

---

## Phase 4 — WASI host for compiled modules · [post-MVP] ← key differentiator · 🚧 started

**Goal:** Run unmodified `wasm32-wasi` binaries as first-class processes (the thing that makes WorkerOS a JS+WASM OS, not a Node polyfill).

- Program worker gains a WASM path: instantiate a `.wasm` with imports bound to the kernel's WASI host + `otf:*` dispatch (§5.1, §6). **✅ done** — `kind === "wasm"` entries read from the VFS, instantiate with the WASI P1 host (`workeros-programs/wasi`), and call `_start`.
- Validate against real binaries: a `wasm32-wasi` build of a small CLI runs unmodified, reading VFS and writing stdout. **✅ done** — the **SAB synchronous-syscall channel** (ADR-010/-016) is built (`workeros-web/sync-syscall.js`), so a real rustc-built `wasm32-wasip1` binary runs unmodified with correct stdio/exit **and** reads the VFS (`std::fs::File::open`/read), seeks (`fd_seek`, backed by a `sys_seek` kernel binding), lists directories (`fd_readdir`), renames (`path_rename`), and blocks on `stdin` from a pipe. A `curl` program downloads a wasm over HTTP into the VFS so it can be run. Remaining: `esbuild-wasm`/PGlite and an off-the-shelf CLI (`jq`/`ripgrep`) as the marquee proof.
- Integrate a WASM **library** tool end-to-end (esbuild-wasm or swc-wasm) as a callable build step. **⏳ gated on Node compat.** The underlying capability is proven — a spike drove **esbuild-wasm** installed via the OS's own `npm` (loads its ESM API + `esbuild.wasm` from the VFS `node_modules`, runs the Go service on-thread with `worker:false`, bundles+transpiles a multi-file project through a VFS resolver plugin, verified in a real browser). But that spike required a bespoke `/bin/esbuild` driver baked into a core package, which violates the clean-OS goal, so it was **backed out**. The right shape: esbuild ships as a normal package (`npm install esbuild-wasm`) whose **own** `bin/esbuild` runs under `/bin/node`, with `node_modules/.bin` on PATH — no OS-specific shim. That needs the Phase-5 Node-compat parts below (VFS-backed `fs`/`path`, `worker_threads` or its no-worker fallback, `node:` builtins) plus **npm bin-linking** and **`node_modules/.bin` on PATH** (PATH is currently just `/bin:/sbin`). Track it there, not as a core program.
- PGlite as a process in its own worker: `import`, query, and a `ps`-visible/killable wrapper (§5.1). Document the daemon-costume caveat. **⏳ TODO**

**Exit criteria:** an off-the-shelf `wasm32-wasi` CLI runs with zero source changes and correct stdio/exit; PGlite runs a query inside a WorkerOS process without freezing the kernel. *(Substantially met for the WASI host: rustc-built `wasm32-wasip1` binaries run unmodified with full stdio/exit + VFS reads/seek/readdir/rename + blocking stdin. The WASM-library build step is proven as a spike (esbuild-wasm bundles a multi-file project) but not shipped — it belongs on the standard `npm`+`node` path once Node compat lands, not as a core program. Still to prove: an off-the-shelf CLI like `jq`/`ripgrep`, and PGlite.)*

---

## Phase 5 — Package manager · [post-MVP] · 🚧 in progress

**Goal:** `install` real packages into the VFS.

- Fetch npm tarballs from the registry (§8, ADR-008); unpack into `node_modules` in the VFS. **✅ done** — `npm` is a guest program (`workeros-programs`, `/bin/npm`): packument fetch, semver resolution, tarball download → in-browser `DecompressionStream` gunzip → untar, transitive deps.
- Node-style resolution in the guest node layer (`workeros-programs/node`): the `require`/`import` `node_modules` walk, `package.json` `main`/`exports`. (Stays in the guest layer — INV-1.) **✅ CommonJS `require`** works (`node index.js` resolves installed packages); ESM `import` of installed packages and `node:` builtins are still TODO.
- Lockfile + integrity; dedupe. **⏳ TODO** — dedupe is currently basic (hoist, first-writer-wins); no lockfile yet.
- Node compatibility is an **ongoing, incremental** effort (grow `workeros-programs/node` over time), not a one-shot. The concrete pending work is scoped below.

### Node-compat — pending work

The goal is that **real npm packages and their bins run on the host JS engine** via the guest node layer (INV-1) — *not* by hosting a foreign runtime (see the out-of-scope note). Two concrete proofs drive the scope: **esbuild-wasm** (its own `bin/esbuild` needs `module`/`path`/**synchronous `fs`**) and **edge.js** (ESM-only, imports `node:fs`/`node:path`/`node:url` and subpath-exported deps). Workstreams, roughly in dependency order:

- **A · Synchronous VFS `fs` builtin** ⏳ — the keystone. Expose the per-process **SAB sync-syscall channel** (already used by the WASI path; `sync-syscall.js` + `makeSyncCaller`, ADR-010/-016) to JS programs, and implement `fs` sync ops (`readFileSync`/`writeFileSync`/`statSync`/`readdirSync`/`mkdirSync`/`openSync`/`readSync`/`closeSync`/`existsSync`/`realpathSync`) + thin async/`fs.promises` on top. Needed because tools do runtime file I/O that can't be prefetched the way the CJS `require` graph is today.
- **B · Core builtins** ⏳ — promote the `path` subset in `require-runtime.js` to a real `node:path`; grow `process` (`cwd`/`chdir`/`hrtime`/`nextTick`/`stdout.isTTY=false`/`versions`); add `os` (`platform`/`EOL`/`tmpdir`/`homedir`), `url`, `module` (`createRequire`), `crypto.getRandomValues`, `tty.isatty→false`.
- **C · `node:` builtin resolution** ⏳ — resolve both `require('fs')` and `require('node:fs')`, **and** `import … from 'node:…'`, to the builtin registry (wire into `require-runtime.js` resolve and the kernel ESM resolver as runtime-provided externals).
- **D · ESM `import` of installed packages** ⏳ — extend `sys.resolveGraph` (the kernel ESM resolver) to walk `node_modules` with `package.json` `exports`/`module`/`browser` and **subpath exports** (e.g. `@poppinss/utils/lodash`). This is the gate for ESM-only packages like `edge.js`.
- **E · npm bin-linking + PATH** ⏳ — `npm install` creates `node_modules/.bin/<name>` for packages with a `bin` field (a generated launcher, since the VFS has no symlinks), and shell command resolution prepends `./node_modules/.bin` (walking up) ahead of `/bin:/sbin` — so an installed package's command is runnable as a bare name, the standard Unix/npm model, with **no OS-specific shim baked into core**.

**Proof targets (add opt-in browser tests when green):** `npm install esbuild-wasm && esbuild src/main.ts --bundle` runs the package's own bin under `/bin/node` (A+B+C+E); `npm install edge.js` then a script that renders a template imports it as ESM (C+D+B). A spike already proved esbuild-wasm loads + bundles from the VFS, but via a bespoke `/bin/esbuild` driver that was **backed out** to keep core clean (Phase 4 note).

**Out of scope — hosting a foreign runtime.** Dropping a prebuilt Node-compatible runtime *binary* into WorkerOS is not the path. Concretely, the Edge.js runtime (edgejs.org) ships an `edge-wasix` build, but it is not a portable WASI guest: its 61 MB V8-in-WASIX module imports **284 host functions** — the full **WASIX** extension surface (`wasix_32v1`: threads/`futex_*`, sockets/`sock_*`, `epoll_*`, `proc_spawn3`/`proc_exec4`), a **shared imported memory** + `wasi.thread-spawn`, and **~198 host-provided N-API functions** (`napi` + `napi_extension_wasmer_v0`, Wasmer's V8 embedding API). It would fail at instantiation (link error) and would require WorkerOS to become a Wasmer-compatible WASIX + N-API host with real threads/sockets/fork — enormous and partly at odds with the browser sandbox (ADR-008: no raw sockets). Node compat comes from running packages on the host engine, not from embedding another runtime.

**Exit criteria:** `install express` (or similar pure-JS package) then a script that imports and uses it runs correctly; a Vite-class dependency tree installs. *(Partially met: pure-JS packages with transitive deps install and run under `require` — e.g. `is-even`; larger ESM/tooling trees pending on the workstreams above.)*

---

## Phase 6 — Preview / networking simulation · [post-MVP]

**Goal:** "Servers" that a browser can actually hit.

- `otf:preview` + Service Worker interception: a guest "server" registers routes; SW routes `fetch` on the preview URL into the kernel/handler (§8).
- HTTP-server shim in the guest node layer (`workeros-programs/node`) mapping `http.createServer` onto the route registry.
- Target: a Vite dev server boots and its preview URL renders in an iframe.

**Exit criteria:** a Vite (or equivalent) project runs `dev` and the preview URL serves the app through the Service Worker; HMR-style reload optional.

---

## Phase 7 — Persistence & isolation hardening · [post-MVP]

**Goal:** Durability and stronger sandboxing options.

- IndexedDB `Vfs` implementation behind the existing trait; snapshot / COW overlay for "reset project" (§9, ADR-011).
- `Membrane` execution level: frozen intrinsics + proxied global / `ShadowRealm` (§7.1, ADR-009).
- (Optional, later) `Wasm` execution level via a pure-Rust JS engine for strong capability isolation.
- **Protected system paths** (ADR-018): a kernel-level protected-prefix / read-only-subtree check so `/sbin` (system binaries) and other protected paths reject mutating syscalls with `EPERM` — turning today's `/sbin` *convention* into real enforcement.

**Exit criteria:** a project persists across reloads; a project can be reset to a snapshot; membrane level denies ambient `fetch`/globals to a guest while still running ordinary code.

---

## Deferred / explicitly out of scope

- Raw TCP/UDP, real DNS, `net`/`dgram` (ADR-008).
- Native addons / C-ABI (`.node`) (§1.1).
- **Hosting a foreign JS runtime binary** (e.g. Edge.js's `edge-wasix`, a Deno/Bun-in-wasm). These are not portable WASI guests — they import the **WASIX** superset (threads/sockets/`epoll`/fork-exec), a shared imported memory + `wasi.thread-spawn`, and host-provided **N-API** — i.e. they assume a specific embedder (Wasmer). Node compat comes from running packages on the host JS engine (Phase 5), not from embedding another runtime. See Phase 5 "Out of scope — hosting a foreign runtime".
- WASM Component Model / WASI Preview 2 host (forward path only; ADR-005).
- The native/server tier & V8 isolates — that's `es-runtime`, a separate product (ADR-002, §12).
- Spectre-class isolation (ADR-009).
